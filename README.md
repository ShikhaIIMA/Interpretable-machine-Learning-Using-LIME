# Interpretable-machine-Learning-Using-LIME
This repository demonstrates use of Locally Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME) to explain predictions of black-box models.
Machine Learning is used for many real-life prediction problems in healthcare, banking, finance and human resources. Some examples of these prediction problems are Since the decisions given by these models
